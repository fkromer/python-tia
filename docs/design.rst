Design decisions
================

General considerations
----------------------

* Programming paradigms

 * `Functional Programming`_ is favoured to avoid dependencies on state
   and to isolates side-effects.
 * `Object Oriented Programming (OOP)`_ is avoided and used for state-less "namespacing"
   purposes and to provide possible plugin interfaces only.

* Principles

 * `Design by Contract (DbC)`_
 * `Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`_
 * `Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)`_
 * `Principle of least astonishment (POLA)`_

Command line interface
----------------------

*Click* is used to implement the command line interface.

* *Click*: `Click (docs)`_ (`Why click?`_)
  
  * +: nesting of commands
  * +: lazy loading of subcommands
  * ?: based on optparse
  * +: type handling and validation

Other alternatives which have been considered:

* `argparse (docs)`_ (`Why not argparse?`_)

  * ?: built-in magic to guess what is an argument or an option problematic with incomplete command lines
  * ?: does not support disabling of interspersed arguments (not possible to implement nested parsing)

* *Clint*: `clint (github)`_

  * -: archieved, last release in 2015

* *cement*: `cement (docs)`_, `cement (API reference)`_

  * ?: heavy weight (a lot is irrelevant for *python-tia*)

* *docopt*: `docopt (github)`_ , `docopt (docs)`_ (`Why not Docopt etc.?`_)
  
  * -: no rewrap of output to the current terminal width
  * -: no translations (irrelevant)
  * -: parsing only: no argument dispatching, no callback invocation, no type handling
  * -: limited composability: only subcommand dispatching, no automatic subcommand enumeration,
    consistent subcommand behaviour enforcement

Configuration file
------------------

As configuration file format (*semantic mapping*, etc.) StrictYAML is used.
StrictYAML is a type-safe subset of YAML which enables advantages and avoids
disadvantages of YAML. Refer to `Why StrictYaml?`_ for more information about
the advantages of StrictYAML compared to other configuration file formats.
`StrictYaml`_ is used to parse and validate config input.

Version control systems (VCS) interaction
-----------------------------------------

Right now it is planned to support the version control system `git` only.
If you are interested in contributing support for another VCS like Bazaar, Mercurial, etc.
feel free to create pull requests.

The capabilities and known limitations of the packages have been analyzed.
The following characteristics have been considered during evaluation:

- dependencies
- implementation of performance critical logic in C
- supported OS
- interface which would allow to implement semantid diffs

The following alternatives have been evaluated to implement interaction with
the version control system (VCS) `git`.

- `git` (`git documentation`_ / `git source code`_) (via `subprocess.Popen()`)
- Dulwich (`Dulwich documentation`_ / `Dulwich source code`_)

  "Dulwich is a Python implementation of the Git file formats and protocols, which does not depend on Git itself."

- GitPython (`GitPython documentation`_ / `GitPython known limitations`_ / `GitPython source code`_)

  "GitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain, or low-level like git-plumbing."

Semantic diff
-------------

Initially it was planned to use packages which provides "semantic diff" capabilities.
In comparison to a "file scope diff" a "semantic diff" contains contextual information
about the changes of source code files (instead of types of file states and line based differences).

In case of a Python language aware semanitc diff: Instead of beeing able to work with
the diff information "file xxx and file yyy was modified" one could work with information like
"in file xxx class a method b was modified and module scope function c was moved to file yyy".
This would allow to improve the granularity of the *impact map* and *coverage map* significantly.
Sadly at time of writing no packages are known which provide the required functionality
(reliability, completeness w.r.t. Python language entities) be used for semantic diffs.

The following alternatives have been evaluated to implement granular, semantic *determination of (file) changes* below the file level with semantic diffs.
However no alternative is usable and has not been evaluated in more detail.

- `Semantic Diff`_ is highly experimental and doesn't support Python 3.
- `SemanticMerge`_ is commercial and doesn't support Python 3.
- `Smart Differencer`_ is commercial and doesn't support Python 3.

Test runner
-----------

For unit tests as usual my prefered choice: `pytest (docs)`.
